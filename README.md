### Hi there 👋
🐁 *Analyzing videos of animal behavior?*  <br/>
[behavior-opto-analysis](https://github.com/philshams/behavior-opto-analysis) has some neat functions for visualization and video registration
 <br/> <br/>
 🔬 *Processing brain sections?* <br/>
 Check out some image analysis tools I've worked on: [SHARP-Track](https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF) and [slicereg](https://github.com/brainglobe/slicereg).
 <br/> <br/>
 📐 *Want a reinforcement learning gridworld based on Euclidean distances rather than grid distance?* <br/>
 Check out [Euclidean_Gridworld_RL](https://github.com/philshams/Euclidean_Gridworld_RL).
 <br/> <br/>
 🧠 *New to programming or neuroscience?* <br/>
 Try [CodingWithNeuralActivity](https://github.com/philshams/CodingWithNeuralActivity), a beginner's tutorial made for BrainCamp Kosovo 2019.
 <br/> <br/>
 ⚡ *Just want to focus on your own projects?* <br/>
`pip install focus-time`    ->   `focus`
 <br/> <br/>
